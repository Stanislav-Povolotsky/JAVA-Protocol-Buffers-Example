## Working with Protocol Buffers in JAVA 

Uses latest version of *com.google.protobuf* 3.21.5 (version can be easily changed by modifying *protobufVersion* in build.gradle file).

To run this example, you can execute:

```bash
./gradlew run 
```

This example is based on [Working-with-Protocol-Buffers-in-JAVA](https://github.com/AdityaKshettri/Working-with-Protocol-Buffers-in-JAVA "Working-with-Protocol-Buffers-in-JAVA") example by @AdityaKshettri.
> In this project, I have worked with basics of Protocol Buffers Concept in Java using Gradle environment, by generating model classes from .proto files and using it for data handling.
